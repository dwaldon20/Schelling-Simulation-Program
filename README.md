If you look at the racial distribution of multi-ethnic cities, you'll see an incredible racial segregation. Many would conclude from such phenomena that people are intolerant, and don't want to live next to people that are different from them. A deeper look, however, might provide some nuance. In the 70's, Thomas Schelling, the 2005 Economics Nobel Prize winner, was interested in this subject and built an agent-based model called the "Schelling segregation model" for explaining this phenomenon. With a very simple model, Schelling could show that what we see at the macro level may not in fact represent what's going down in the micro level.
